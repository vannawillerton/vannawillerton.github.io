# The Dirichlet Process

### Topics to cover from ProbMods 
1. Introduction and Motivation for non-parametric distributions
..* In section on Generative Models, we talked about 'goodness of fit' of a model to some data. Parametric models using a fixed finite number of parameters may end up with a poor matching between the complexity of the model and the data. We talked about some evaluation metrics for model selection.
..* Non-parametric approaches fit single model which adapts it's complexity based on the data given instead of having the complexity of the model given as a parameter. 
2. Define DPs as a generalization of Dirichlet Distribution
..* Dirichlet Process is a stochastic process, essentially a distribution over distributions.
..* Draws from the Dirichlet Process are themselves discrete distributions over the simplex $$\Theta$$.
..* Parameters $$\alpha$$ (concentration param. Positive real number) and $$H$$ (base distributiob. Distribution over the simplex $$\Theta$$)
3. Describe formally the generative model
$$useBasicLatexCommandsLikeThis?$$

4. Constructing a DP with stick-breaking?
5. Constructing a DP with CRP
..* CRP is a prior distribution
..* Sequential sampling scheme using restaurant metaphor
..* Useful properties: simplicity bias (wants fewer customers, tables, assigns N customers to smallest number of tables), rich-get-richer.
6. Pitman-Yor Process (small generalization of CRP with extra param)
7. The Nested Chinese Restaurant Process?
8. Hierarchical DPs?
